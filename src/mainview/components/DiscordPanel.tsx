 * The Discord Rich Presence: a switch, and a mark beside it saying where the

 * running is the ordinary case — so without it the switch would have no visible
 * effect at all until a client happened to be up and a track happened to be
 * playing. A refusal earns a row as well as a mark: it is the one state the user
 * can usually do something about.
