/**
 * Renders the real `<App/>` against whatever state you put in the DATA section
 * below. Copied into `src/mainview/` by `render.ts` for the length of a run and
 * deleted afterwards, which is why it can sit at the vite root and use `@/`.
 *
 * **The data below is an example, not a fixture — rewrite it for whatever is
 * being previewed.** A long queue, an empty library, an artist with one track,
 * a failed download: all of it is authored here, per preview. Only the wiring at
 * the bottom is meant to survive.
 *
 * Two rules hold the whole thing up, both invisible until they're broken:
 *
 *   - **Every stubbed getSnapshot returns one hoisted constant.**
 *     `useSyncExternalStore` compares by identity, so building the object inside
 *     the arrow is "Maximum update depth exceeded", not a render.
 *   - **Nothing here fires an RPC.** Each service refetches off a session
 *     *change*, and no subscriber is ever notified, so the stubs can be plain
 *     assignments after a static import.
